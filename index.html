  <br>Note 1 main menu theme:Starting off with the bottom video of the main menu, the game starts off with a peaceful tune, but as the game continues to remain at the main menu you will notice that the tune will start to change into a more suspense and action tune that was looped from the beginning of the sound which kinda makes you realize what you will expect in the game. When it comes to fighting games, there would usaually the theme songs they play often use some sort of action themed music letting players feel excited to get into the game just like how they would get excited to watch a fighting tournament on national television. But with Mortal Kombat 1 the music theme starts off as a slow peaceful sound until it turns into a more suspenseful and action sound knowing what's about to happen when you continue to remain in the main menu throughout the game until you go further into the game.</br>

 
  <br>Note 2 MK1 footage:With the footage above is a gameplay while taking place at a certain stage/arena. During the stage, you see a group of people which they are also known as monks who are in the background which is similar to Barthes Reality Effect. The reason why I state that is because it is a feeling that you were a monk and was there with that group when the Kombat happened in that stage and saw everything. But the reality part can be pretty weird because it has you thinking you were there when you really weren't there. And it's the kind of feeling that doesn't go through people's minds that often knowing it is a fighting game, but it lets you imagine yourself being in that event in reality where it took place and saw the fight yourself realizing that every match takes place somewhere else.</br>
