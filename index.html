<br>.For this analysis, I wanted to break down the sound and effect for the main menu of Mortal Kombat 1</br>

  <br>The game starts off with the main menu. While staying at the main menu and not selecting any optioons to choose from the game you will notice the sound changing throughout the main menu.</br>
 <br> The game starts off the sound as peaceful in the main menu. But as you continue to stay at the main menu, the sound of the tune starts changing into a more suspenseful tune which sort resembles the ound of action.
