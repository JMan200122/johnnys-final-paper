  <br>Note 1 main menu theme:Starting off with the bottom video of the main menu, the game starts off with a peaceful tune, but as the game continues to remain at the main menu you will notice that the tune will start to change into a more suspense and action tune that was looped from the beginning of the sound which kinda makes you realize what you will expect in the game. When it comes to fighting games, there would usaually the theme songs they play often use some sort of action themed music letting players feel excited to get into the game just like how they would get excited to watch a fighting tournament on national television. But with Mortal Kombat 1 the music theme starts off as a slow peaceful sound until it turns into a more suspenseful and action sound knowing what's about to happen whenyou continue throughout the game. </br>
